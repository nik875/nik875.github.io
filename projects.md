title: My Projects
---

This page is a hub for information on all the large-scale projects I've undertaken. It's meant as an extension to my resum√© that provides some more information about my work. What you'll find on the other end of each of these links is a concise, intuitive explanation of the work I did and why it matters.

None of these webpages have been through the scientific peer-review process, and none are substitutes for peer-reviewed scientific studies (please see the final publication, if it's available). All events recounted are told from my own perspective and are meant as a reflection upon me, not anyone else involved. More than to provide an objective recollection of facts, my goal here is to capture the experience of working on these projects.

## TJ Space Program

My largest undertaking over four years of high school, where I led a team of high-school-only students in putting together and launching a 2U CubeSat to Low-Earth Orbit. Webpage coming soon!

## Independent Research

Starting in my last year of high school, I conducted independent research into the applications of machine learning in microbial genomics studies for dataset visualization. Paper and full webpage coming soon!

## [EDIT ML Internship](https://nik875.github.io/projects/edit)

Between my junior and senior high school years, I worked on a small team to conduct novel research into image unmasking at Dartmouth's EDIT ML internship.

## [Vex Robotics](https://nik875.github.io/projects/vex)

I personally competed in the Vex Robotics Competition in all three of my middle school years, and coached middle school team for three of my high school years.

## Open Source

I've only just started dipping my toes into the open source world, but so far, I like what I see. Webpage coming soon.
