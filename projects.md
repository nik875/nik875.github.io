title: My Projects
---

This page is a hub for information on all the large-scale projects I've undertaken. It's meant as an extension to my resum√© that provides some more information about my work. What you'll find on the other end of each of these links is a concise, intuitive explanation of the work I did and why it matters.

None of these webpages have been through the scientific peer-review process, and none are substitutes for peer-reviewed scientific studies (please see the final publication, if it's available). All events recounted are told from my own perspective and are meant as a reflection upon me, not anyone else involved. More than to provide an objective recollection of facts, my goal here is to capture the experience of working on these projects.
