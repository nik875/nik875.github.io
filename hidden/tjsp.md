The name "Space Program" is actually something I created towards the end of my senior year; for most of my high school career, the club was called TJ NanoSat. This was because its primary mission was to build small cube satellites (known as CubeSats) and launch them to orbit. The club's biggest accomplishment as of the time of writing is the successful assembly of its first independent satellite, TJ REVERB (many years prior to this, there had been a separate satellite built by a different team in partnership with Orbital Sciencesâ€”read more about that [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/fairfax-county-students-build-first-satellite-sent-to-space/2013/11/19/015db0ea-508f-11e3-9fe0-fd2ca728e67c_story.html)). REVERB had been started in 2016, long before my time.
